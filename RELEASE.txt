  on the SCons download page:

          https://scons.org/pages/download.html

  Here is a summary of the changes since 4.0.1:

  NEW FUNCTIONALITY

    - Added Environment() variable TEMPFILEDIR which allows setting the directory which temp
      files createdby TEMPFILEMUNGE are created in.

  DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY

    - N/A

  CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY

    - N/A

  FIXES

    - Fix fortran tools to set SHFORTRAN variables to $FORTRAN, similarly SHF77, SHF90, SHF95,
      SHF03 and SHF08 will default to the variables $F77, $F90, $F95, $F03 and $F08 respectively.
      If you were depending on changing the value of FORTRAN (or $F[0-9][0-9]) having no effect
      on the value of SHFORTRAN, this change will break that.   The values of FORTRAN, F77, F90,
      F95, F03, F08 and SHFORTRAN, SHF77 (etc.) now are not overridden in generate if alredy set
      by the user.
    - Fix subprocess execution of 'lslpp' on AIX to produce text standard i/o.
    - Re-do the fix for suncxx tool (Oracle Studio compiler) now that only Python 3 is supported,
      to avoid decoding errors.
